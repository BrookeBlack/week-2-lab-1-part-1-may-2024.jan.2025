    <h1>Cardign Welsh Corgi</h1>
    </p>
    <div>
        <p>The Cardigan Welsh Corgi is a masterpiece of the breeder's art: Every aspect of its makeup is perfectly
            suited to moving cattle, and yet it is so congenial and sweet-faced that it would be a cherished companion
            even if it never did a day's work. Long, low-set dogs with sturdy bone, short legs, and a deep chest,
            Cardigans are powerful workers of deceptive speed and grace. Cardis can weigh anywhere from 25 to 34 pounds,
            with females at the lower end of the scale. They come in several coat colors, from red to the popular
            blue-merle pattern. The quickest way to distinguish Cardis from their cousins, Pembroke Welsh Corgis, is to
            check out the hindquarters: Cardigans have tails; Pembrokes do not. Cardis are trainable, faithful, and
            vigilant guardians with a 'big dog' bark. Well-socialized Cardis are especially fond of kids and agreeable
            with other pets. These athletic, rugged herders have a love for the outdoors, and they thrive on mental
            stimulation and physical activity.</p>
